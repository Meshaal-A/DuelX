# DuelX

**DuelX** is an engaging two-player fighting game built with Python and Pygame. This project features exciting gameplay mechanics, unique characters, and dynamic animations, making it a perfect choice for retro game enthusiasts and developers interested in Python-based game development.

## Features
### **Two Distinct Fighters**
- **Warrior**: A skilled melee combatant with powerful sword-based attacks. The Warrior excels in close-range combat with fast and devastating strikes. 
- **Wizard**: A magical fighter capable of casting powerful spells. The Wizard has the advantage of long-range attacks, using fireballs and other spells to damage the opponent from a distance.

### **Gameplay Mechanics**
- **Health Bars**: Each fighter has a health bar that decreases when they are hit. The first player to reduce the opponent's health to zero wins the round.
- **Smooth Animations**: Each fighter has animations for different actions including idle, running, jumping, attacking, getting hit, and dying.
- **Scoring System**: The game tracks the number of rounds won by each player. The player with the most rounds wins the match.

### **Dynamic Background**
- The background changes with each level and features blur effects during the main menu for an immersive cinematic experience.

### **Sound Effects and Music**
- **Background Music**: Engaging soundtracks are used for each level.
- **Attack Effects**: Impact sounds and special effect sounds are played when an attack lands or a spell is cast.

### **Responsive UI**
- **Main Menu**: The main menu includes options for starting the game, checking the score, and exiting the game.
- **Victory Screen**: After each match, a victory screen shows the winning fighter and the number of rounds won.

### **Custom Controls for Two Players**
- The game is designed for two players, each controlling a fighter using custom controls for movement, jumping, and attacking.

### **Level Progression**
- The game progresses through multiple levels, each with its own challenges and difficulty:
  - **Level 1**: The initial level where players learn the basic mechanics of the game. The enemies are relatively easy to defeat.
  - **Level 2**: A harder level where enemies are faster, stronger, and use advanced tactics.
  - **Level 3**: The final showdown, where the player faces the hardest opponent with enhanced abilities, including faster attacks and better defensive strategies.

### **Screen Transitions**
- **Smooth Fade Effects**: When transitioning between rounds or levels, fade effects are applied to give the game a cinematic flow. This includes transitions between levels and after each round.

### **Game Reset and Countdown**
- After each round, the game automatically resets the fighters and a countdown is displayed before the next round begins. This countdown creates suspense and prepares the players for the next fight.

### **Additional Features**
- **Combo System**: Players can chain attacks together to create powerful combos that deal more damage. The combo system rewards skill and timing.
- **Special Abilities**: Each fighter has a unique special ability that can be activated after a certain threshold of damage is dealt. The Warrior can perform a powerful sword slash, while the Wizard can unleash a destructive magic spell.
